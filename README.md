CS2 Strategy Game

Description:

First, a random number between 3 and 7 is chosen. This will be the number of rows. On each row, there will be some number of stones. At the beginning, there are three stones on the first row, and then one more on each successive row. So for example, if there are 4 rows, the rows will look like the following at the beginning of the game:

Row 0: * * * (3 stones)
Row 1: * * * * (4 stones)
Row 2: * * * * * (5 stones)
Row 3: * * * * * * (6 stones)

Gameplay alternates between two players. On a player’s turn, the player chooses a row and a number of stones to take. They must choose a row with at least one stone on it, and they must choose a non-zero number of stones. They can choose to take anywhere from 1 stone to all the stones on that row. The object of the game is to take the last stone.

Gameplay Example
For example, suppose the game starts with four rows:

Row 0: * * * (3 stones)
Row 1: * * * * (4 stones)
Row 2: * * * * * (5 stones)
Row 3: * * * * * * (6 stones)

Player 1 might choose to take 2 stones from row 2. Then the game looks like:

Row 0: * * * (3 stones)
Row 1: * * * * (4 stones)
Row 2: * * * (3 stones)
Row 3: * * * * * * (6 stones)

Player 2 might choose to take 2 stones from row 3 now:

Row 0: * * * (3 stones)
Row 1: * * * * (4 stones)
Row 2: * * * (3 stones)
Row 3: * * * * (4 stones)

Player 1 might take all 3 stones from row 0 now:

Row 0: (0 stones)
Row 1: * * * * (4 stones)
Row 2: * * * (3 stones)
Row 3: * * * * (4 stones)

Player 2 might take 1 stone from row 2:

Row 0: (0 stones)
Row 1: * * * * (4 stones)
Row 2: * * (2 stones)
Row 3: * * * * (4 stones)

Player 1 might take all the stones from row 1:

Row 0: (0 stones)
Row 1: (0 stones)
Row 2: * * (2 stones)
Row 3: * * * * (4 stones)

Player 2 might take 3 stones from row 3:

Row 0: (0 stones)
Row 1: (0 stones)
Row 2: * * (2 stones)
Row 3: * (1 stone)

Player 1 might take 1 stone from row 2:

Row 0: (0 stones)
Row 1: (0 stones)
Row 2: * (1 stone)
Row 3: * (1 stone)

Player 2 can take the stone from row 3:

Row 0: (0 stones)
Row 1: (0 stones)
Row 2: * (1 stone)
Row 3: (0 stones)

Now player 1 wins by taking the stone from row 2.

(This example does not necessarily reflect the input/output that your project may use).

Directions
First: your project will need to allow the user to select the players. It should give a choice between three types of players: Human, Simple Computer, and Smart Computer. You should allow all game types (there are 9, allowing for the difference between Human vs Simple and Simple vs Human).

The game starts with picking a random number between 3 and 7 for the number of rows. (Use the nextInt method in the Random class for this). Then display the board (you can just output the row number and how many stones are left in each row).

Player 1 gets to make a move. If the player is a computer, output the move (the row number and the amount of stones they take). If the player is a human, you need to ask the user to input the row number and the amount of stones to take. Then decrease the number of stones in the chosen row by that amount.

Continue with Player 2 making a move. The game continues until all the stones have been taken away. The player who takes the last stone wins. At that point, the program should output who the winner was.

Strategies
You must implement a Simple computer player that follows the following strategy:

Find the first row that has any pieces left.
Take one piece from that row.
You must also implement a Smarter computer player. You are to come up with another strategy that should hopefully be better than the Simple strategy. (There are some obvious improvements; for example, the Simple strategy does not force a win when it should be able to).

For the Human player, allow the user to input in the row and number of pieces to take. Don’t worry about validating input, just make sure it’s usable.
